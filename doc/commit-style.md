# Commit style

English | [Русский](./commit-style.rus.md)

Commit style accepted in __IX-Ray__ project

## Overview

The project accepts commit standard for transparency and comprehension of the changes being made. The acceptable commit style is described below

## General rules

- Commit messages must be written in English.
- Each commit message should be structured to answer the question: __"If this commit is applied, it will..."__
- The message must start with a verb in the infinitive form without the `to` particle
- No flags like `[Fix]`, `[UPDATE]`, or other tags should be included. The verb should directly describe the action performed
- Commit messages should be brief but descriptive, with additional details added in a long description if needed
- Capitalize the first letter of the commit message
- If you are unsure how to write in English, clearly describe what you did in your native language (no gibberish, we will translate and refine it later)

## Commit message structure

### Initial commits

Initial commit messages should follow this structure:

```text
Initial commit
```

### Regular commits

Regular commit messages consist of one part, optionally followed by a long description:

```text
<Commit message body>

<Long description if necessary>
```

### Length guidelines

- The maximum length for the commit message header is __72 characters__
- Each line in the long description should also not exceed __72 characters__

## Writing commit messages

### Header format

The commit message header must begin with a verb in the infinitive form that describes the action taken in the commit. Examples:

- `Fix window manager implementation`
- `Implement audio output support`
- `Remove obsolete configurations`
- `Add documentation for API endpoints`
- `Optimize rendering pipeline`

#### Specific rules for nouns

If the message includes a noun, make sure to structure it naturally for clarity:

- `Implement new devices support (preferred)`
- `Add new gizmo support (preferred)`
- `Add support for AMD FSR (less desirable, use the structure above)`
- `Implement support for new devices (less desirable, rephrase as shown in the examples above)`

It is recommended to place the main noun after any qualifiers when possible for better readability

### Examples of correct messages

#### Single-line messages

- `Fix memory leak in database connector`
- `Refactor logging system for clarity`
- `Update README with installation instructions`
- `Remove deprecated API calls`

#### Messages with long descriptions

```text
Fix rendering issue in graphics pipeline

The rendering pipeline had a bug causing frame drops on low-end GPUs. This fix optimizes shader execution and resolves the issue.
```

```text
Add unit tests for input validation

Unit tests cover edge cases for user input to ensure stability and prevent crashes during unexpected inputs.
```
